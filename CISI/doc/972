Graph Model for Library Information Networks.AKorfhage, Robert R..ABhat, U. Narayan.ANance, Richard E.
   The design and study of library information networks are enhanced by the use of the concepts which have been developed by graph theorists.. In this paper weexpand upon this theme, proposing a general network structure which we believeto be a good model for a wide variety of library and other information networks.. The basic concepts from graph theory are illustrated with the aid of a hypothetical Public Library Access Network (PLAN)..
