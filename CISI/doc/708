An Efficient Design for Chemical Structure Searching. I. The Screens.AFeldman, Alfred.AHodes, Louis
   A method has been developed for generating efficient screens for chemicalstructures.. Fragments are generated by an algorithm under control of filestatistics.. The fragments obtained are normalized by weighting their codepatterns.. Superimposition of these codes yields the screen codes for thestructures..
