  A major problem in the design of screening systems for substructure searchesof chemical structure files is the development of a methodology for selection ofan optimal set of structural characteristics to act as screens.  The set chosenfor a particular application will depend on the characteristics of thecollection, as well as on its size and growth rate.  A strategy which takesaccount of the disparate frequencies of the various species of fragmentsin a data-base by use of differential, and, in part, hierarchical levels ofdescription is detailed.  The distributions of a variety of structuralcharacteristics, including bond-centered, atom-centered, and ring fragmentsin a 30,000-compound sample of the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Systemare summarized.  Implementation of the approach, using primarily bond-centeredfragments, by means of simple and highly efficient computer programs, isdetailed.
