The Structure of Scientific Literatures II: Toward a Macro- and Microstructure for Science.AGriffith, B.C.Small, H.G.Stonehill, J.A.Dey, S.
  Part I of this paper described the first steps in mapping the scientificliterature, using a new technique - co-citation - to measure the degree ofsimilarity among documents.  The work developed directly from an earlierpaper which defined this measure, and explored its relationship to othercitation measures for identifying relationships among documents.  We nowreport the outcome of an attempt to create 'maps' of the scientific literature.The scales of these maps have been systematically manipulated so that theypresent, not only an overview of all highly-cited papers in natural science, butalso a detailed view of a single scientific specialty.  At each level we havesystematically sought indications of the validity of the mapping operation,and have indications that the maps display at least certain important aspectsof the specialty structure of science.
