    This paper describes the design and implementation of an "electronic filingmachine," a machine which is capable of storing large numbers of "unstructured"documents in such a way a particular document may be easily and quickly retrieved.  A functional distributed architecture permits the implementationof the system in a mixture of hardware and software..B(Computer, Vol. 14, No. 5, May 1981, pp. 24-36)
