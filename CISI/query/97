    There has been a good deal of work on information retrieval systems thathave continuous weights assigned to the index terms that describe the recordsin the database, and/or to the query terms that describe the user queries.Recent articles have analyzed retrieval systems with continuous weights of either type and/or with a Boolean structure for the queries.  They have alsosuggested criteria which such systems ought to satisfy and record evaluationmechanisms which partially satisfy these criteria.  We offer a more careful analysis, based on a generalization of the discrete weights.  We also lookat the weights from an entirely different approach involving thresholds, andwe generate an improved evaluation mechanism which seems to fulfill a largersubset of the desired criteria than previous mechanisms.  This new mechanismallows the user to attach a "threshold" to the query term..B(JASIS, Vol. 32, No. 3, May 1981, pp. 211-216)
