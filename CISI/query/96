    Several papers have appeared that have analyzed recent developmentsin the problem of processing, in a document retrieval system, queries expressedas Boolean expressions.  The purpose of this paper is to continue that analysis.We shall show that the concept of threshold values resolves the problems inherent with relevance weights.  Moreover, we shall explore possible evaluationmechanisms for retrieval of documents, based on fuzzy-set-theoretic considerations..B(Information Processing & Management, Vol. 17, No. 3, 1981, pp. 127-136)
