    An automated document clustering procedure is described which does notrequire the use of an inter-document similarity matrix and which is independentof the order in which the documents are processed.  The procedure makes use ofan initial set of clusters which is derived from certain of the terms in theindexing vocabulary used to characterise the documents in the file.
