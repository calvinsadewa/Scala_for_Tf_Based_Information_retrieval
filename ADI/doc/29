a statistical image recognition function related tointegral geometry and its instrumentation in a statisticaltransformation generator ..AG. TENERY
the concept of using a statistical image transformation as a key step in image recognition has been studied by computer simulation, analytical studies relating the transformation to classical integral geometry, and constructionof a prototype analog statistical image transformationgenerator .
